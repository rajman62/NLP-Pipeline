# general rule, any sequence of non separator character is matched:
[^ \t\n.?!'",]+

# The '#' character is used to put comments. All lines not starting with '#' is considered as a regex to be added to the
# FSA. The regex syntax is the one defined by the brics automaton lib: http://www.brics.dk/automaton/doc/index.html
# Special characters have been added to the syntax: \t and \n map to tab and new line, the \ character is now an escape
# character. \\ needs to be used to match \. < > characters can be used to defined the boundaries of a regex. For
# example:

<green card>

# separator characters can be included in wordFSA

# in that case, the ambiguity will be left in the chart, and the syntactic or semantic modules will have to solve it.
